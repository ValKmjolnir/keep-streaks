# __Keep-Streaks__

I just wanna keep the streaks.

## __Nasal__

This program needs __Nasal__ runtime: [ValKmjolnir/Nasal-Interpreter](https://github.com/ValKmjolnir/Nasal-Interpreter)

Run this program using this command, then push process will be triggered with an interval:

> ./nasal auto-push/main.nas

Run this program using this command, this will push immediately and exit:

> ./nasal auto-push/push.nas

### __Auto-Push__

Stores two scripts to keep streaks
